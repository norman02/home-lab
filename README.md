# ðŸ§ª Home IT Lab â€“ Virtual Corporate Network Simulation

This project simulates a small-to-medium corporate IT environment using VirtualBox, Parrot OS, and a mix of Linux and Windows virtual machines. It is designed to demonstrate hands-on skills in system administration, cybersecurity, automation, and documentation.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goals

- Build and manage a segmented internal network with firewalls, SIEMs, vulnerable systems, and user endpoints.
- Automate common IT tasks using Bash and Python.
- Simulate help desk workflows using osTicket and a library of scripted tickets.
- Apply real-world system hardening and security practices.
- Document everything clearly for professional review.
